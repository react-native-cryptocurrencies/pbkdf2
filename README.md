This is a Fork of pbkdf2 fixing some issues and using native hashing functions for performance & better security.

This is not suitable for production use. No tests / Broken tests.

*DISCLAIMER: This is a partial release extremely experimental (as a result of modifying some existing modules to make them work for a customer) and it's definitively not suitable for production usage unless the incorporated code is throughly checked with testing. I will try to revamp these libraries fully adapted for RN ready for production as soon as I have time. This is only the result of experimeting and coding for an external customer to solve a specific issue with a very specific setup.*
